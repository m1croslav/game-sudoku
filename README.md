# Sudoku Solver in Aleo

This is a Sudoku Solver program implemented in the Aleo programming language. It provides the ability to check whether a given Sudoku board is complete and adheres to the rules of Sudoku. Sudoku is a popular logic-based number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 grids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## Program Structure

The Sudoku Solver program is structured as follows:

- **Structs:**
  - `Row`: Represents a single row in the Sudoku board with 9 cells.
  - `Board`: Represents the complete Sudoku board consisting of 9 rows.

- **Functions:**
  - `check_sequence`: An inline function that checks if a sequence of 9 numbers adheres to Sudoku rules. It returns `true` if the sequence is valid, meaning it contains numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
  - `check_for_complete`: A transition function that takes a `Board` as input and checks if the entire Sudoku board adheres to the rules. It checks each row, column, and the 3x3 subgrids for completeness.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the Aleo development environment set up.
2. Deploy the Sudoku Solver program on an Aleo smart contract platform.
3. Call the `check_for_complete` function, passing a `Board` as an argument to check if the Sudoku board is complete.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use this program to check if a Sudoku board is complete:

```aleo
transaction main() {
    let sudokuBoard = Board {
        r1: Row {c1: 5, c2: 3, c3: 4, c4: 6, c5: 7, c6: 2, c7: 1, c8: 9, c9: 8},
        // Add values for the remaining rows here
    };
    
    let result = check_for_complete(sudokuBoard);
    if result == 0u8 {
        // The Sudoku board is complete and valid.
        debug("Sudoku board is complete and valid.");
    } else {
        // The Sudoku board is not complete or contains errors.
        debug("Sudoku board is not complete or contains errors.");
    }
}
```
